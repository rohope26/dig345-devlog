### DevLog 2-1 

#### Create an Astro Starlight DevLog site

Follow the [Astro Starlight](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/) tutorial to create a JAMstack website with Astro.js. You will use this site to post DevLog entries to record your work throughout the semester.

1. [Fork an Astro Starlight site](https://omundy.github.io/dig345-radical-software/tutorials/astro-starlight/#create-an-astro-starlight-site) and update project structure.
1. Publish Astro Starlight using Github Actions ✏️ https://github.com/rohope26/AstroBlog
1. Add custom CSS to your theme
1. Import and use an Astro component
1. Continue customizing your site using the [Starlight Docs](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) and ✏️ explain what you did.
I read through all of the starlights docs, but my dev environment was not working properly so I was unable to implement any changes. I'll work on this but won't be done by tomorrow.
1. Add content into: `devlog-1-3.mdx` (the DevLog from the previous week)
1. Add this file and `devlog-2-1.mdx` for today, and add content.
1. Watch 🎬 Heydon Pickering [Why is everything binary?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbjxvvKEtyE). Post a reading response in the 2-1 DevLog per information in the [Assignments](./assignments).
I found the video to be a bit wacky but intersting. The main takeaway I got was that we use 1s and 0s to create data but things are often more complex than a binary.
1. Write a reflection explaining what you did learned in this DevLog. Link to sources.
    I hadnt used git pages before so bulding and deploying the page was new to me. 
1. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle
