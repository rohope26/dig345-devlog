### DevLog 3-3 

#### Create a full stack application using Node and Express

Create a full stack application following Chapter 9 of Critical Web Design and the [Bad Password API Node/Express](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-09/9-4-bad-password-api/) tutorial. <DevLogInstructions filename="devlog-3-3.mdx" />

1. Read 📚 Chapter 9 in Critical Web Design. ✏️ I was already aware of the fact that my data is always being tracked and often sold to advertisers. However, I did not realize the extent of how much data is being collected and how it is being used. It reminds me of a recent article I read that explained that tv's are getting cheaper because smart tv's are able to track all of our clicks on the tv and in turn these tv companies make money by selling our tv's data to advertisers. 
1. Fork an existing Github project ([criticalwebdesign/bad-password-api-starter](https://github.com/criticalwebdesign/bad-password-api-starter)) (CWD 9.3)
1. Connect to a remote API and use JSON data in a frontend (CWD 9.3)
1. Modify the project structure, install dependencies, and run the project. (CWD 9.4) 
1. Add static and dynamic API routes using Express.  (CWD 9.4) 
1. Create a free Vercel account  (CWD 9.4) 
1. Deploy your project on Vercel. (CWD 9.4)  Paste the link ✏️ ross-class-bad-password-api-starter.vercel.app
1. Read 📚 [Hacktivist deletes white supremacist websites live onstage during hacker conference](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/hacktivist-deletes-white-supremacist-websites-live-on-stage-during-hacker-conference/), TechCrunch 2026 Post a reading response in your DevLog per information in the [Assignments](./#assignments).
1. Write a reflection explaining what you learned in your DevLog. Link to sources. ✏️ In addition to learning about api routes using express, and developing a full stack website, I learned a lot about safe internet practices. Pretty much everything we do online is being tracked and sold to advertisers. The importance of strong passwords was also emphasized by showing how quickyl passwords can be cracked and how our sensitive information can be sold. This devlog was a nice introduction to full stack development while aslo emphasizing computer security and privacy.
1. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle.
